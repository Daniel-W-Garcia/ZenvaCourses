**Brazil: A Persistent Threat Assessment for US National Security**

**Executive Summary:** Brazil presents a complex and evolving security landscape with persistent threats to US national security interests. Despite the departure of former President Bolsonaro, significant challenges remain, including political instability, economic vulnerabilities, strategic resource competition, organized crime, and a shifting geopolitical alignment. Continuous, targeted intelligence monitoring is crucial to maintaining an accurate understanding of the situation and mitigating potential risks.

**I. Political Landscape & Instability – A Continued Risk**

Brazil’s political environment remains highly volatile. The enduring influence of Bolsonaro supporters within key institutions – including the military and law enforcement – poses a significant threat. This influence could fuel extremist groups and potentially interfere with US diplomatic efforts.  Coupled with the upcoming 2026 presidential elections, the potential for shifts in policy and increased political instability demands close scrutiny of candidate platforms and their alignment with adversarial state interests. *Sources: Reuters, The Guardian, Brookings Institution, Electoral Brasil, Folha de S.Paulo.*

**II. Economic Vulnerabilities & Strategic Interests – Resource Competition**

Brazil’s economic instability, characterized by inflation and currency fluctuations, creates vulnerabilities that could lead to social unrest. Critically, Brazil’s significant reserves of lithium, cobalt, and nickel – essential minerals for US technological advancements – make it a point of strategic competition. Increased Brazilian state control over these resources, coupled with potential protectionist policies, could disrupt supply chains and hinder US economic competitiveness. *Sources: IMF, Trading Economics, US Geological Survey, Reuters, Peterson Institute for International Economics, US Department of Commerce.*

**III. Security Forces & Organized Crime – A Layered Threat**

The Brazilian military continues to wield considerable influence in domestic and foreign policy. Assessing the capabilities and operational doctrine of the Rapid Deployment Brigade (BRDE) remains vital. Simultaneously, Brazil’s status as a hub for organized crime – particularly drug trafficking (cocaïne) and illegal mining – presents a multifaceted threat. The potential involvement of the military and law enforcement in criminal activities requires ongoing scrutiny. Moreover, Brazil's growing digital economy creates vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats. *Sources: Jane's Intelligence Online, Defense News, Global Financial Integrity, UNODC, Cybersecurity Ventures, Brazilian Government Cybersecurity Agency (SENAD).*

**IV. International Relations & Alliances – Shifting Alignments**

Brazil’s deepening strategic partnership with China presents a long-term challenge to US influence in Latin America. The maintenance of robust intelligence regarding Brazil’s relationship with Russia, including arms sales and intelligence cooperation, is paramount.  Brazil’s participation in the BRICS alliance underscores the evolving geopolitical landscape and potentially strengthens China’s global influence. *Sources: Council on Foreign Relations.*

**V. Emerging Trends – Environmental and Social Instability**

Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest – driven by illegal activities – has severe implications for climate change and potentially for strategic resources.  Escalating deforestation rates exacerbate instability and could embolden criminal elements.  Furthermore, monitoring indicators of social unrest – including poverty levels, inequality, and public dissatisfaction – is critical for identifying potential flashpoints. *Sources: NASA, INPE (Brazilian National Institute for Space Research).*

**Conclusion:**

Brazil’s security landscape requires sustained attention.  While the US should pursue constructive engagement with Brazil, a realistic assessment of the ongoing threats – political instability, economic vulnerability, strategic resource competition, organized crime, and geopolitical realignment – is essential for informing effective US national security policy. Continued, targeted intelligence gathering, including human intelligence sources, will be invaluable in maintaining an accurate understanding of this evolving threat landscape.
